# cs224FinalProject
A shared repository for a group project in CS224

Authors: Seth Campbell, Noah Shirey, Drew Ellery

The purpose of the project is to create a 2D, circular, doubly-linked list that can be used as a library for exact cover problems.



---IMPORTANT INFORMATION---

1) Although this library is intended for exact cover problems, it was written to be robust enough to handle all sorts of matrix implementations.
This should be evident in our test cases.

2) One of our test cases demonstrated our implementation on a large scale. As is, the test takes about 30 seconds to complete.
In order to shorten this time you may do one of the following:
    a) Remove, or comment out lines 567-580
    b) Replace the values on lines 571, and 572 with smaller values

3) All tests can be run either through terminal, by executing the file, or through an IDE with built in test support, such as PyCharm.
